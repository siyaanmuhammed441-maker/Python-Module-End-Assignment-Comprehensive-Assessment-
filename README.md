# 📊 Employee Data Analysis Project – ABC Company

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis task performed on an employee dataset from **ABC Company**, consisting of **458 rows and 9 columns**.  
The goal is to preprocess the dataset, analyze employee information across teams and positions, and visualize key insights using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess employee data
- Analyze employee distribution and salary expenditure
- Identify predominant age groups
- Study correlation between age and salary
- Visualize insights using graphs

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization

---

## 📂 Dataset Details
- **Rows:** 458  
- **Columns:** 9  
- Key columns used:
  - `Team`
  - `Position`
  - `Age`
  - `Salary`
  - `Height`

---

## 🔄 Preprocessing
- The `Height` column was corrected by replacing values with **random integers between 150 and 180** to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## 📊 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Employee Distribution by Team
- Calculated total employees per team
- Computed percentage split relative to total employees
- Visualized using bar chart

### 2️⃣ Employee Segregation by Position
- Grouped employees based on job positions
- Displayed distribution using bar graph

### 3️⃣ Predominant Age Group
- Employees categorized into age groups:
  - 18–25
  - 26–35
  - 36–45
  - 46–55
  - 56–65
- Identified the most common age group

### 4️⃣ Salary Expenditure Analysis
- Identified:
  - Team with highest total salary
  - Position with highest salary expenditure
- Visualized salary distribution

### 5️⃣ Age vs Salary Correlation
- Calculated correlation coefficient
- Represented relationship using a scatter plot

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included
